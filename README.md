# Build guide

Prior to building, you will need basic knowledge of [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet).

### Requirements
- Around 100G disk space.
- A computer with at least 16GB RAM running Linux (recommended) or MacOS.
- Build environment [setup](https://github.com/akhilnarang/scripts). 

### Instructions
1. Run the following commands to sync source

```
repo init -u https://github.com/Project-Awaken/android_manifest -b 11
```
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To save more time and space, you can do a shallow clone using

```
repo init --depth=1 -u https://github.com/Project-Awaken/android_manifest -b 11
```

2. To sync source, enter

```
repo sync -c -j$(nproc --all) --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags
```

3. Once the source is downloaded/synced, prepare your device trees, dependencies and start the build.
